Disclaimer and Scope of Creative Commons Licences
Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distributing Creative Commons public licences does not create a lawyer-client or any other relationship. Creative Commons offers its licences and related information on an “as-is” basis and makes no warranties regarding the licences, any material licensed under their terms, or any related information. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use.
Guidance on Using Creative Commons Public Licences
Creative Commons public licences set out standard terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders can use to share original works of authorship and other material covered by copyright and certain additional rights specified in the licence. The considerations outlined below are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and are not part of the licence terms.
For Licensors
* These public licences are designed for those authorised to grant the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and related rights.
* Licences are irrevocable. Licensors should thoroughly review and understand the terms and conditions before applying a licence.
* All necessary rights should be secured before applying the licence to ensure the public can reuse the material as intended.
* Any material not subject to the licence—such as other Creative Commons licensed material, or material used under copyright exceptions or limitations—should be clearly marked.
* Further guidance for licensors can be found at: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
For the Public
* By applying a public licence, a licensor gives the public permission to use the material under the specified terms and conditions.
* If the licensor’s permission is not needed (for example, due to a relevant copyright exception or limitation), the licence does not apply to that use.
* The licences grant only those permissions under copyright and similar rights that the licensor can grant; other restrictions may still apply if other rights holders are involved.
* Licensors may make special requests, such as asking for modifications to be marked; while not required under the licence, it is encouraged to respect these requests where reasonable.

Summary of the Licence Terms
Agreement and Acceptance
By exercising the Licensed Rights, you accept and agree to the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public Licence (“Public Licence”). If interpreted as a contract, you are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of your acceptance, and the Licensor grants these rights in consideration of the benefits from making the material available under these terms.
Section 1 – Definitions
* Adapted Material: Material based on the Licensed Material that is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a way requiring permission from the Licensor. For musical works, this always applies when synchronised with moving images.
* Copyright and Similar Rights: Copyright and related rights including, but not limited to, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights.
* Effective Technological Measures: Measures that cannot be circumvented without authority under relevant laws or treaties.
* Exceptions and Limitations: Legal exceptions such as fair use or fair dealing for your use of the material.
* Licensed Material: The work, database, or other material to which the Licensor has applied this Public Licence.
* Licensed Rights: Permissions granted under this Public Licence, limited to copyright and similar rights the Licensor can license.
* Licensor: The individual or entity granting rights under this licence.
* NonCommercial: Not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. Non-commercial exchange via digital file-sharing is included if there is no payment involved.
* Share: Making material available to the public by any means requiring permission under the Licensed Rights.
* Sui Generis Database Rights: Special database rights, particularly those under Directive 96/9/EC and similar legislation.
* You: The individual or entity using the Licensed Rights under this Public Licence.
Section 2 – Scope
Licence Grant
* The Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable licence to:
* Reproduce and share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only.
* Produce and reproduce, but not share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.
If Exceptions and Limitations apply, this licence does not apply, and you do not need to comply with its terms.
The licence covers all media and formats, and permits technical modifications necessary to exercise the rights; such modifications alone do not create Adapted Material.
Every recipient of the Licensed Material receives the same offer under the same terms. No additional terms or technological measures may be applied that restrict others’ rights.
This licence does not imply any endorsement or official status by the Licensor or those designated for attribution.
Other Rights
* Moral rights (such as the right of integrity), publicity, privacy, and similar rights are not licensed, though the Licensor waives or agrees not to enforce these as necessary to allow use of the Licensed Rights.
* Patent and trademark rights are not licensed.
* The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties for NonCommercial uses, but reserves these rights for other uses.
Section 3 – Licence Conditions
Attribution
* If you share the Licensed Material, you must:
* Retain identification of the creator(s), copyright notice, licence references, disclaimers, and a URI or hyperlink if provided.
* Indicate if you have modified the material, and retain any previous modification indications.
* State that the material is licensed under this Public Licence and include the text, URI, or hyperlink to it.
You may fulfil attribution requirements in any reasonable manner for the medium and context.
If requested by the Licensor, you must remove any attribution information where reasonably practicable.
You may not share Adapted Material.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights
* If the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights:
* You may extract, reuse, reproduce, and share all or a substantial portion of the database contents for NonCommercial purposes, provided you do not share Adapted Material.
* If you combine the database with one in which you have Sui Generis Database Rights, the new database (not its contents) is considered Adapted Material.
* Sharing a substantial portion of the database requires compliance with Section 3(a)'s attribution conditions.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability
* Unless specifically stated otherwise by the Licensor, the Licensed Material is provided "as-is" and "as-available" with no warranties, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors.
* To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Licensor shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or other damages arising from the use of the Licensed Material, even if advised of such possibilities.
* Where disclaimers or limitations are not allowed, these may not apply to you. The above provisions are to be interpreted as a complete waiver of liability where possible.
Section 6 – Term and Termination
* This Public Licence applies for the duration of the relevant Copyright and Similar Rights.
* If you breach the licence, your rights terminate automatically. They may reinstate automatically if the breach is remedied within 30 days of discovery, or by express reinstatement from the Licensor.
* The Licensor may offer the material under other terms or cease distribution, but this does not end the licence for copies already distributed.
* Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of the licence.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions
* The Licensor is not bound by any additional terms communicated by you unless expressly agreed.
* Any separate arrangements not stated in this licence are independent of these terms and conditions.
Section 8 – Interpretation
* This Public Licence does not limit or restrict any lawful use of the Licensed Material that does not require permission.
* If any provision is unenforceable, it will be reformed to the minimum necessary to be enforceable, or severed if reform is not possible, without affecting the rest of the licence.
* No term is waived or compliance excused unless expressly agreed by the Licensor.
* Nothing in this licence limits or waives any legal privileges or immunities of the Licensor or you.
